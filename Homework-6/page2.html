        <h1>Gates of Oblivion</h1>
        <br />
        <p>An art piece I made during the Summer of 2021. Signifying the dark, ominous, and mysterious land that is Oblivion. The Reaper watches over this land. A world with with so many questions to be answered. Does it exist? Or is it a plane of non-existence. A small quote I wrote to reflect the mystery surrounding it.
        <br />
        <br />
          <i>"Beyond these gates you will find nothing, but something does wait for you..."</i>
